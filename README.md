### Example Code: Basic Regex Matching in Python

Here's a simple Python code snippet to illustrate basic Regex pattern matching:

```python
import re

def find_dates(text):
    # Regex pattern to match dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD
    date_pattern = re.compile(r'\b\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\b')
    # Find all matches in the input text
    dates = date_pattern.findall(text)
    return dates

# Example Usage
# example_text = "The event dates are 2023-10-01 and 2023-12-15."
# found_dates = find_dates(example_text)
```
